# Database MySQL foundation course - Laboration 4

## JPA/Hibernate with DAO pattern against MySQL database

This was our fourth major assignment for our MySQL database course. In this assignment we used Hibernate and the DAO pattern to connect Java with a book database.
Also includes simple tests of Hibernate mechanics, like inserting a book, returning a list of all books, get by ID or Title or similar, price, etc.

*Please don't judge my old newbie self too harshly. Hopefully my later projects speaks for themselves* :)
